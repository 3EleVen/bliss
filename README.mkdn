Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/BeanStalk, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the BeanStalk trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/pimpmaneaton/android.git -b pimp1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please see any of the official beanstalk XDA threads for building instructions.
